# WordSearchPuzzle

This program generates a word search puzzle board with random words found on the web.
In case the auto web search for words fail for any reason, a backup pool of words (backupwords.txt) will be used instead.

Currently, it supports words printed in 4 directions:
	top to bottom
	bottom to top
	left to right
	right to left

The size of the board is hardcoded 15, but that can be customized as necessary


Output example:
How many words would you like to search in the puzzle? [min 1, max 10]:
>> 8
